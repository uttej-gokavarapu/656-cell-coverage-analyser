# 656-cell-coverage-analyser
A Python application to simulate the downlink behavior of two base stations with sectored antennas directed on to road to serve the mobiles traveling on the road. This Application also focuses on exploring the effects of down tilting antennas on cell performance from both coverage and interference/throughput point of view.
